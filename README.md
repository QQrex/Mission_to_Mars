# Mission_to_Mars

## Overview

We have been employed to scrape a handful of space related websites for imagines and news about Mars. Once the data has been collected, we saved the data to a MangoDB repository and create a flask app to display our findings. We also added a web scraping button to our flask app to update the featured news and image on our flask app.
